## Current Snapshot

- Current task: maintain a working Revenge plugin repo with GitHub Pages install-link deployment.
- Known caveat: install URLs (for example `/SplitLargeMessages/`) intentionally render the `404` info page in browsers; users should copy the link into Revenge rather than open it directly.
- Recent status: Node/Rollup build pipeline is active and GitHub Actions deploys `dist` to `gh-pages`.
